# Reddit Client

This is a simple Reddit viewer client that I created in order to learn Django's templating engine. Thus, the main focus was on the UI and how the image/video content was displayed. It doesn't store anything in the database and each request to the site queries a [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) client for data. Color scheme is adapted from [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).
